# Advanced MDX Techniques

This document covers {difficulty.toLowerCase()} techniques for working with MDX.

## Featured Topics

{advancedFeatures.map((feature, index) => `- ${feature}`).join('\n')}

## Custom Components

You can create custom components and use them directly in your MDX:

```tsx
const CustomAlert = ({ type, children }) => (
  <div className={`alert alert-${type}`}>
    {children}
  </div>
);
```

# State Management in MDX

Working with React hooks in MDX content.

## Available Hooks

{hookExamples.map(hook => `- ${hook}`).join('\n')}

## Example Implementation

```tsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const StatefulComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch data or perform side effects
  }, []);
  
  return <div>Dynamic content: {data}</div>;
};
```

# Best Practices

Essential practices for MDX development:

{bestPractices.map((practice, index) => `${index + 1}. ${practice}`).join('\n')}

## Performance Tips

- Lazy load heavy components
- Use React.memo for expensive renders
- Minimize re-renders with proper key usage
- Profile your components regularly
