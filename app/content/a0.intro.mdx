# Introduction to MDX

{greeting}

This is an introduction to MDX, a powerful format that combines Markdown with JSX.

Version: {version}

## What is MDX?

MDX allows you to write JSX directly in your Markdown documents. This makes it incredibly powerful for creating interactive documentation.

- ✅ Write JSX in Markdown
- ✅ Import React components
- ✅ Use variables and expressions
- ✅ Create interactive content

# Examples

Working with {codeExample}

## Code Example

```tsx
import React from 'react';

const InteractiveComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Count: {count}
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

This shows how you can create interactive components within your MDX content.
